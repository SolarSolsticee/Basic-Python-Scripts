Hi there, I'm Erick Pepek ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I focus on developing practical Python tools to support the scientific community.

ðŸ”¬ What I Do
I create a range of Python scripts and utilities specifically designed to aid in lab research and data analysis. My goal is to build clean, efficient, and useful tools that can streamline complex workflows and help researchers get the most out of their data.

On my profile, you'll find repositories containing scripts for:

Data Processing & Cleaning: Tools to prepare datasets for analysis.

Automation: Scripts to handle repetitive tasks in a lab environment.

Data Visualization: Utilities to create clear and informative plots.

Custom Analysis: Specific solutions for various research challenges.

Feel free to browse my projects. I hope you find something that helps with your work!
